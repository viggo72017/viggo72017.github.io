by M. Montalvo (<i>reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2018</i>)<br></p>

<p>"I saw <b>Cinema Paradiso</b> some years ago and again last month but the regular version. I decided to get the director's cut and the extra 30 min was well worth it. It answered some questions which were left up in the air in the shorter version. I don't know why they cut it but the director's cut DVD is a must. The acting, writing and ensemble were magnificent. It's 2 Â½ hours of pure enjoyment. Will probably make it a new tradition a once a year viewing with my friends."</p>

<p><span class="subhead">WARM, REALISTIC, STORY</span><br> 
by Charles Polinger (<i>reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2018</i>)<br></p>
<p>"One of my favorite movies, about a young boy and his relationship with a film operator. This movie harks back to the days when movie houses had projectionists, and it is easy to imagine how they learned techniques to make their jobs more efficient. It is wonderful to see the young boy's admiration for the projectionist, and desire to learn "the trade." Of course, the young boy does not stay young forever, and <b>Cinema Paradiso</b> follows the aging of both the projectionist and the boy. I liked the simple story, the unique subject, the small-town atmosphere and the acting. It was an easy film to follow, unlike many today that have xx number of characters and intertwining stories."</p>

<p><span class="subhead">LOOKS BEAUTIFUL IN 4K!</span><br>
by Russell (<i>reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2020</i>)<br></p>
<p><b>"Cinema Paradiso</b> is one of my favorite Italian films. It's about a man named Salvatore (nicknamed Toto) who falls in love with films as a boy, which continues into adulthood. His mentor Alfredo was a great inspiration to Toto, encouraging him to leave their small town and never look back. Toto also finds love with the beautiful Elena, which leads to one of the most gorgeous shots of them kissing in the rain."</p>
		 
<p><span class="subhead">SPELL BOUND IN DARKNESS</span><br>
by Glow Worm (<i>reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2019</i>)<br></p>

<p>"If you're a born cynic who connects only with the perfunctory or the present then <b>Cinema Paradiso</b> is probably not for you. Paradiso evokes remembering, childhood and adolescence, that intense sensory experience, fantasy through film, lost love, romantic dreams that don't come true, what could have been and youth gone forever.
The Director's cut: The chief protagonist did the boy no favor thwarting his adolescent and youth to brutally cut ties with his family, great love and roots in exchange for fame/fortune transitioning him from his Paradiso fantasies to devising scenarios for movie screens without ever attaining the emotional maturity to come to terms with an inner self not realized and arguably more substantive, real and important."</p>
